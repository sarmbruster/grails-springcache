The _Springcache_ plugin allows you to easily add the following functionality to your Grails project:

 * Caching of Spring bean methods (typically Grails service methods).
 * Caching of page fragments generated by Grails controllers.
 * Cache flushing when Spring bean methods or controller actions are invoked.

The plugin depends on the "EhCache":http://ehcache.org/ and "EhCache-Web":http://ehcache.org/documentation/web_caching.html libraries.
